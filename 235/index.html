                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Tyler! I'm a 2nd year GDD student here at RIT, 
                    and my main interest within game design is level design.
                    I'm super into indie games and some games with level editors!
                    In 235, I'm excited to be able to make a portfolio for myself, and as for GDD/RIT
                    as a whole, I really just want to make a video game that I can be proud of.
                </p>
