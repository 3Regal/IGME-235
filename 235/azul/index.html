            <h2>What is Azul?</h2>

            <p>
                In <strong>Azul</strong>, players take turns drafting tiles from a supply and placing them in
                <br>their palace. Players score based on how they place their tiles, and earn bonus
                <br>points for building specific patterns. Incomplete sets of tiles end up damaging
                <br>one's score, making <strong>Azul</strong> a game about careful planning and keeping an eye
                <br>on your opponents' palaces.

            <p>
                This is because when the game is played with only 2 players,
                <br>drafting choices <em>heavily</em> influence what your opponent can take.
                <br>This results in a game not only about your board of tiles, but also
                <br>very much about what <em>your opponent is trying to accomplish on theirs</em>.
